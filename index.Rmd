Welcome to the R Bootcamp for PSU Psychology researchers. The goal of this two-day workshop is to provide a broad introduction to the use of R for social science research. Participants are not expected to have prior experience with R or another programming language. The scope and schedule of the course is provided [here](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp/schedule.html).

**Note**: If possible, please bring a laptop, preferably with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) already installed. We will be walking through a number of demonstrations during the course and it may be useful to follow along on your own machine.

To download all course materials, you can clone the entire Github repository using the command ```git clone https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp.git```. If Git is unfamiliar, you can obtain a zip archive of the current version of all files here: <https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp/archive/master.zip>
